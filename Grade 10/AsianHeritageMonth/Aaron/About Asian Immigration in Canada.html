Each year, as part of its annual Asian Heritage Month campaign, the Government of Canada encourages all people in Canada to learn about how people of Asian origin have and continue to help shape Canada as we know it today. Below are just a few examples of the numerous diverse communities of Asian heritage which trace their ancestry back to more than 40 different countries, each with their own unique history and lived experiences. In May 1788, the British fur trader, Captain John Meares arrived at Nootka Sound on Vancouver Island with 50 Chinese artisans who helped build a trading post. The following year, an additional 70 Chinese workers arrived to help build a fort and a schooner. With the discovery of gold in British Columbia in 1858, Chinese immigrants from San Francisco began arriving in the Fraser River Valley the following year. Later on, Barkerville, British Columbia was established as the first Chinese community in Canada.";
